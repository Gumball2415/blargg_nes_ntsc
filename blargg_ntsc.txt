Command line usage:
nes_ntsc    [input.bmp] [output.bmp]
nes_ntsc    input.bmp output.bmp -c [-scanoff] [-mergeoff <burstphase>] [-hue <value>]
    [-saturation <value>] [-contrast <value>] [-brightness <value>] [-sharpness <value>]
    [-gamma <value>] [-resolution <value>] [-artifacts <value>] [-fringing <value>]
    [-bleed <value>] [-vidmode cvbs|svid|rgb|mono] [-sony]
    [-decodematrix <ir> <qr> <ig> <qg> <ib> <qb>]

    [input.bmp]     Input.bmp file. "test.bmp" by default.
    [output.bmp]    Output .bmp file. "filtered.bmp" by default.
    -c              Uses the following commandline parameters instead of opening a window:
    [-scanoff]      Turns off scanline effects. On by default.
    [-mergeoff]     Disables merging even and odd fields together to reduce flicker. Burst phase is 1 by default.
    [-hue]          <value> ranges from -1.00 (-180 deg) to 1.00 (+180 deg). 0 by default.
    [-saturation]   <value> ranges from -1.00 (grayscale) to 1.00 (oversaturated). 0 by default.
    [-hue]  <value> ranges from -1.00 to 1.00.. 0 by default.
    [-contrast]     <value> ranges from -1.00 (dark) to 1.00 (light). 0 by default.
    [-brightness]   <value> ranges from -1.00 (dark) to 1.00 (light). 0 by default.
    [-sharpness]    <value> ranges from -1.00 to 1.00. 0 by default.
    [-gamma]        <value> ranges from -1.00 to 1.00. 0 by default.
    [-resolution]   Image resolution.
    [-artifacts]    Artifacts caused by color changes.
    [-fringing]     Color artifacts caused by brightness changes.
    [-bleed]        Color bleed (color resolution reduction).
    [-vidmode]      Selects a video mode. "cvbs" by default.
    [-sony]         Turns on Sony decoder. Off by default.
    [-decodematrix] Specifies a custom decoding matrix. This overrides any decoder used.

As an alternative to the command line, you can drag the input BMP onto the EXE file.

Moving the mouse left or right adjusts sharpness.
Moving the mouse up or down adjusts gamma.

Press space to toggle merge fields.
